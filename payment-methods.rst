Payment Methods
**********************

To make the membership system work, we need at least add one payment method so that the system can handle the registrations and orders
. We can do it in the menu ``Payment Mthods``.

We can then use the ``New`` at the top right corner to add payment methods from the the methods built-in the system.

.. note:: For basic users, only Off-line Payment and PayPal are available. Other payment methods need the premium membership. Please `contact us`_ if you need to add more custom payment gateways.

After adding a payment method, please configure it with your account settings.

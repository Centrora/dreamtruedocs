Magazine and Newspaper
------------------------------

With Dreamtrue membership, we can easily build a magazine / newspaper subscription website.

Scenario:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The website provides different magazines, newspapers or any other publications.

2. The publication contents are managed by Joomla! articles K2, the 3rd party extension.

3. A subscription controls one or several publications.

4. The subscription can be monthly, semiannually, annually, etc, and it can be one-off or auto recurring.

5. If a publication is controlled by a subscription, front-end users cannot read the full contents. The site admin can choose to show some specific contents to public for free.

6. Front-end users need to subscribe the subscription which controls the publication to have the full reading access.

7. There are 2 modes available, *A)* the subscriber can view all existing issues of the publication when the subscription is active, or *B)* the subscriber can only view the issues which are created within the subscription period.

Front-end Workflow:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Site visitors

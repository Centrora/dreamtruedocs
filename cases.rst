==================================================================================


.. _magazine:

------------------------------
Magazine and Newspaper
------------------------------

With Dreamtrue membership, we can easily build a magazine / newspaper subscription website.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scenario:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The website provides different magazines, newspapers or any other publications.

2. The publication contents are managed by Joomla! articles K2, the 3rd party extension.

3. A subscription controls one or several publications.

4. The subscription can be monthly, semiannually, annually, etc, and it can be one-off or auto recurring.

5. If a publication is controlled by a subscription, front-end users cannot read the full contents. The site admin can choose to show some specific contents to public for free.

6. Front-end users need to subscribe the subscription which controls the publication to have the full reading access.

7. There are 2 modes available, *(A)* the subscriber can view all existing issues of the publication when the subscription is active, or *(B)* the subscriber can only view the issues which are created within the subscription period.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Front-end Workflow:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. When accessing the issue of the publication, site visitors will be shown a message describing the subscription and giving the signup link.

2. If the user has the subscription, he/she can login and can continue reading on the same page.

3. If the user is not a subscriber, he/she can choose to subscribe it. After the subscription, the user is redirected to the Member Panel link or back to the issue before the subscription (definable by the site admin).

4. The subscriber can manage the subscription in the Member Panel and also check the list of all publications/issues he/she can view.

5. Optional setting: the contents which the subscriber has viewed are still available even after the subscription is expired.


.. _club:

--------------------------------
Club Membership
--------------------------------

Dreamtrue Membership can build the website for the club membership registration.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scenario:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. The website provides different memberships of the club.

2. Memberships have different prices and lengths.

3. The registration form can collect the custom user information defined by the site admin.

4. Export the members list and detailed information.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Front-end Workflow:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The membership page shows all memberships.

2. The user chooses one to buy.

3. The user is redirected to the Member Panel after the payment.

4. There the user can print the membership card or get the unique membership code.

5. The site admin will get the notification for the registration.

6. The site admin can periodically export the new members to make the membership cards and deliver them by post.
